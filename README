Google Picasa Camera Template

Here is my template for Google Picasa which will allow you to easily
create stunning responsive slideshows directly from Google Picasa.
Simply choose a folder og individual pictures in Google Picasa,
goto menu "folder" and select the "Camera, Responsive HTML slideshow"
from within wizard found under "Export to HTML".

It will be created to a folder which can be uploaded to your website,
voila! You have your pictures from your computer online in a great
slideshow.

Installation and use:
=====================

   looking something like this:

2) Open Google Picasa
3) Select the images you want to be included in the
   Camera slideshow gallery 
4) In the menu "Folder" select the "Export to HTML" (I only have a
   Danish version,menu items might be some other names)
5) Choose "Camera"
6) Name the slideshow gallery and click export.

- Done... :-)
